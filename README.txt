# FiveThings-TheDayOffTripGuide
GDG / Udacity Android for Beginners Final project Rev.0 (styling and functionality will be added)

The project purpose is to provide user with information regarding types of active sports which they can perform on weekend or day off. 


According to the idea the app should contain such information as:
•	Short description  of activity;
•	“Musthave” things;
•	Interesting locations (with link to maps via intent); / to be added to rev.0 until 10.04.16
•	Helpful internet resources (links via intent);        / to be added to rev.0 until 10.04.16

In the version 0 it contains such activities as hiking, bicycle touring, camping and snowboarding (the things which author prefer to do on his day off). In the nearest future is planned:
•	to add some activities like kayaking, wakeboarding, kite-boarding, surfing, diving and maybe other; 
•	to add the checkbox to select the season of year or the medium (like water, snow, mountains) - when the one of checkboxes will be selected - only the activities which satisfy the conditions will be displayed to the user.
